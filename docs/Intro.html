<h3>In recent decades, the urgency to understand and monitor our
planet’s forests has spurred significant advancements in remote sensing
and data analysis techniques. Global Forest Watch (GFW), an initiative
since 2014, has been at the forefront of providing accessible data on
forests worldwide. Groundbreaking datasets like the Tree Canopy Cover,
introduced by the University of Maryland’s (UMD) GLAD Lab in 2013, have
allowed researchers to analyze forest coverage at global scale using a
medium resolution of 30-meters. This data set marked a pivotal
contribution of establishing a baseline for the annual. Within this data
set, tree canopy cover is defined as the density of foliage above five
meters in height within a given pixel, measured from the dependable
Landsat series of satellites.</h3>

<h3>Following this trajectory, the UMD GLAD Lab introduced the Tree
Cover Height dataset in 2021, revealing not just the density of tree
cover but also the vertical dimension as well with the partnership of
Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR measurements. This
data set is distinguished by its precision estimating tree height
changes which aids the accurate assessment of forest biomass and carbon
storage because of their linear relation.</h3>

<h3>It is also important to note that the data set that this project
uses, defines trees as woody vegetation of at least three meters in
height and is estimated by the height of the tree canopy in meters
within a 30-meter pixel from Global GEDI LiDAR measurements and Landsat
imagery. This data set estimates the 95th percentile of tree canopy
height, and accordingly will represent the upper bounds of height for
pixels with fractional tree cover, or pixels with variable canopy
height. Afterwards, the data is aggregated and vectorized into
sub-national polygons. Thus, this data may take the form of natural
forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. “Loss”
indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a
variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or
storm damage.</h3>

<h4>This project also provides Local and Global Moran’s I analyses to
classify clustering, dispersion, or randomness. This approach is also
supplemented by a Monte Carlo simulation to assess how “typical” or
“atypical” the data may be relative to a randomly distributed pattern of
gain and loss across the counties. Along with that, I provided hot zone
(High-High) and cold zone (Low-Low) maps which depict neighboring
counties that are statistically significant or in the &lt;.05 p-value
range. In summary, Moran’s I provides a quantitative measure of how
forest gain and loss are distributed across a landscape, offering
insights that can inform management decisions, policy development, and
conservation strategies. It is a valuable tool in the spatial analysis
of forest dynamics, helping to ensure that forest resources are managed
sustainably and that biodiversity is preserved.</h4>

<h4>Improved satellite data: The algorithm uses every available Landsat
image (from the Landsat 5, 7 and, since 2013, Landsat 8 satellites) to
detect tree cover loss. The Landsat 8 satellite has the same resolution
as previous Landsat missions, but has an improved sensor that can better
resolve features on the ground. Incorporation of Landsat 8 data into the
loss algorithm resulted in better detections of tree cover loss smaller
than an individual pixel (e.g. selective logging) starting in 2013.</h4>

<h4>When first looking at our data of our gain and loss maps the
patterns observed in the counties with both high tree cover loss and
gain over the past 20 years may reflect a dynamic landscape where
reforestation and deforestation occur simultaneously or in close
succession. This could be due to a variety of factors, including
forestry practices like clear-cutting followed by replanting, natural
disturbances followed by recovery, or changes in land use where areas
are alternately being deforested for development and other areas being
reforested for conservation. These findings suggest a complex interplay
between conservation efforts, land management strategies, and economic
development, highlighting the need for a sustainable approach to
forestry that balances ecological health with human needs.</h4>

<h4>When expanding past this analysis, there are a multitude of
underlying varaibles that can be assesed. For instance, this can be used
for guiding conservation efforts by our identified areas of significant
forest change Policymakers and conservationists can target interventions
more effectively. therefore, they can focus reforestation efforts in
regions where loss is clustered or protect areas of significant gain.
One other example is understanding ecological Processes: Forest ecology
is inherently spatial. Processes like seed dispersal, wildfire spread,
and disease outbreaks all exhibit spatial patterns. Moran’s I helps
understand these processes by identifying patterns that may indicate
ecological interactions which is related to landscape connectivity: In
conservation biology, landscape connectivity is crucial for maintaining
biodiversity. Moran’s I can indicate the degree to which forested areas
or how in this project, counties are fragmented and connected. This also
has implications for predicting carbon dioxide emission gain over time
we could see in our hot zone clustered areas and how we should take note
of what the cold zone clustered areas are doing to follow suit.</h4>

<h4>This project, using Global Forest Watch data and R, reveals a
nuanced understanding of forest cover dynamics over the past two
decades. Through the analysis, it highlighted not just the areas of tree
cover gain and loss, but also the spatial distribution patterns—showing
significant clustering rather than randomness in these changes. This
suggests that environmental policies, land management practices, and
other regional factors are likely influencing these patterns. The
positive correlation between CO2 emissions and tree cover loss in the
US, particularly within the Pacific Northwest, underscores the
interconnectedness of human activities and forest changes. Overall, this
work contributes valuable insights into forest conservation efforts,
highlighting areas that may require more focused intervention to manage
and mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on forest
ecosystems.</h4>
