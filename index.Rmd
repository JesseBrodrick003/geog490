## Project web page for GEOG 4/595 *R for Earth-System Science* 

This website covers various aspects of tree Cover gain/loss and carbon emissions over the past 20 years within the Pacific Northwest using R Studio and data from Global Forest Watch, an open-source web application to monitor global forests in near real-time. Below are the main sections of the project:

- [Project Overview: Introduction, Methods, Materials and Conclusion](Intro.html)
- [Analyzing Tree Cover Gain](TreeCoverGain.html)
- [Analyzing Tree Cover Loss](TreeCoverLoss.html)
- [Analyzing Tree Cover Loss and Carbon Emission Regression](CarbonF.html)
- [Exploring Spatial Patterns with Local Moran's I](LMI.html)
- [About](about.html)

Explore each section to learn more about the work and findings!
