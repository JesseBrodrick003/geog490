## Materials and Methods: 

#### The materials consist of a GFW dataset on a subnational2 county level for tree cover change. Several packages including (-tidyverse, -sf, -ggplot2,- RColorBrewer,-tigris, -ggplot2, -classInt, -spdep).  

#### Global Forest watch provides thresholds or amount of tree canopy coverage for 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 75 percent for 20 years of forest cover gain/loss in hecatares. In order to stay consistent, as well complete a valid spatial join I used 50% threshold of very dense forest (VDF) and, moderately dense forests (MDF) in which I joined by state and county to Census Boundaries from the TIGRIS package. 

#### Local Morans I:Identifying local clusters and local spatial outliers using row-standardized weights.
